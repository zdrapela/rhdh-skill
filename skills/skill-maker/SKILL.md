# Create Skill

Create agent skills following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## Phase 1: Interview

Interview the user about every aspect of this skill until reaching shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

### Interview cadence

Ask **one question at a time**. Wait for the answer before asking the next. Adapt follow-ups based on what you learn. Each question should provide clear benefit toward building a better skill — cut questions the codebase can answer for you.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead of asking.

Focus areas, roughly in order:

1. **Purpose and audience.** What task does this skill cover? What specific problem does it solve? What does the user do today without it?
2. **Scope boundaries.** What should this skill NOT do? What adjacent tasks belong to other skills?
3. **Input/output.** What does the user provide? What does the skill produce? Specific formats?
4. **Edge cases.** What goes wrong? Common mistakes? Gotchas for new users?
5. **Success criteria.** How do you know the skill worked correctly?
6. **What can be scripted?** Look for deterministic operations that should be code, not LLM instructions. Scripts are cheaper, faster, and more reliable.
7. **References needed?** Domain knowledge too large for SKILL.md that should live in separate files?
8. **Existing patterns.** Similar skills or workflows to draw from? Check the codebase.
9. **Platform constraints.** macOS, Windows, and Linux? Scripts must handle path separators, temp directories, and shell differences.
10. **External services and APIs.** Does the skill call external APIs or services? If yes, read `references/api-skill-patterns.md` — it covers credential handling, schema discovery, instance-specific values, and error placement.
11. **Architecture.** Based on the answers above, decide whether the skill's scope warrants sub-commands, context systems, or setup gates. Most skills don't need this — skip to Phase 2 if the skill is straightforward. If it does, ask:
    - **Should this be one skill with sub-commands or multiple skills?** One skill with a router table prevents menu pollution. Multiple skills are appropriate when the tasks have no shared context or setup.
    - **Does the skill need project-level context?** If every command needs the same background (project config, conventions), design a context file pattern with a loader script.
    - **Are there mandatory setup gates?** Steps that must pass before any work begins (context loaded, config valid, dependencies present). Gates prevent generic output.
    - **Does behavior vary by task type?** If so, design a register/mode system that classifies the task first, then loads different references.

Read `references/architecture-patterns.md` when the skill needs sub-commands, context systems, or setup gates.

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the user confirms the scope is complete.

## Phase 2: Draft the SKILL.md

Write the skill following the spec. Read `references/spec-guide.md` for the full format reference before drafting.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name        # lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars
description: |           # max 1024 chars — this is the ONLY triggering mechanism
  What the skill does. Use when [specific triggers].
  Also use when [additional triggers].
---
```

The description must be slightly "pushy" — agents tend to undertrigger. Include both what the skill does AND specific phrases/contexts that should activate it.

### Body structure

Follow progressive disclosure — three loading levels:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): `name` and `description` loaded at startup for all skills
2. **Instructions** (< 500 lines): Full SKILL.md body loaded when skill activates
3. **Resources** (as needed): `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` loaded only when required

Keep the SKILL.md body under 500 lines. If approaching this limit, split domain-specific content into `references/` files with clear pointers about when to read them.

### Writing patterns

- **Imperative form**: "Run the command" not "You should run the command"
- **Output templates**: Define exact formats when the output structure matters
- **Concrete examples**: Show input → output for non-obvious workflows
- **Gotchas sections**: Common mistakes the agent should avoid
- **Checklists**: Multi-step workflows with validation gates
- **Conditional loading**: "Read `references/api-errors.md` if the API returns a non-200 status code" — not "see references/ for details"
- **Absolute bans**: When certain patterns are always wrong, use match-and-refuse lists. "If you're about to write X, stop and do Y instead." More effective than vague "be careful" guidance.

### Sub-command router (when applicable)

For skills with multiple distinct operations, use a router table in SKILL.md:

```markdown
## Commands

| Command | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `craft [feature]` | Build a feature end-to-end | [references/craft.md](references/craft.md) |
| `audit [target]` | Technical quality checks | [references/audit.md](references/audit.md) |

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Show the command menu. Ask what to do.
2. **First word matches a command**: Load its reference file and follow it.
3. **First word doesn't match**: General invocation using the full argument as context.
```

Back the router with a `scripts/command-metadata.json` as the single source of truth:

```json
{
  "craft": {
    "description": "Full build flow. Use when building a new feature end-to-end.",
    "argumentHint": "[feature description]"
  }
}
```

### Setup gates (when applicable)

Non-negotiable checks before any file edits. Gates prevent generic output from missing context.

```markdown
## Setup (non-optional)

| Gate | Required check | If fail |
|---|---|---|
| Context | Project config loaded via `python scripts/load_context.py` | Run the loader first |
| Config | Config file exists and is valid | Run `skill-name setup` |
| Command | Sub-command reference is loaded | Load the reference |
| Mutation | All gates above pass | Do not edit project files |
```

### Register/mode system (when applicable)

When behavior varies by task type, classify first, then load different references:

```markdown
## Register

Every task is **library** (published, API-stable) or **application** (internal, can break).
Identify before acting. Load the matching reference: [references/library.md] or [references/application.md].
```

### Capability-gating

Steps that depend on optional environment capabilities (browser automation, specific CLI tools) must degrade gracefully:

```markdown
### Automated Scan (Capability-Gated)

Run the automated scanner when ALL of these are true:
- The target files exist and are readable
- The required CLI tool is installed

If unavailable, state in one line that the step is skipped and why. Do not ask the user to install tooling.
```

### Structured artifacts as handoffs

When one command produces output that another consumes, define the artifact structure explicitly. The producing command's reference defines the format; the consuming command's reference says what it expects:

```markdown
### Plan Structure

**1. Summary** (2-3 sentences)
**2. Primary Goal**
**3. Approach**
...
```

### Self-critique loops

For build/implementation commands, mandate inspect-and-fix passes with explicit exit bars:

```markdown
### Critique and fix loop

After the first pass, write a short self-critique and patch. Repeat until no material issues remain:
1. Does it match the requirements?
2. Does it pass the [quality test]?
3. Check every expected scenario.
4. Check edge cases.

The exit bar is not "it works." It is: [explicit quality threshold].
```

## Phase 3: Description Optimization

The description is the only thing agents see at startup. Read `references/description-guide.md` for the full optimization process.

Quick validation:

1. Write 5 should-trigger queries (different phrasings, including ones that don't name the skill directly)
2. Write 5 should-not-trigger queries (near-misses that share keywords but need different skills)
3. Check: would the description correctly distinguish these?
4. Revise if needed — broaden for missed triggers, narrow for false triggers
5. Verify under 1024 characters

For skills with sub-commands, the main description covers the skill broadly. Each sub-command's description in `command-metadata.json` is optimized separately for auto-trigger keyword matching.

## Phase 4: Scripts

Read `references/scripts-guide.md` for the full guide.

**Bias toward scripts.** Every deterministic operation should be a script, not an instruction. Scripts are cheaper (no LLM tokens), faster (no reasoning), and more reliable (no hallucination).

For each piece of the skill's workflow, ask: "Could a script do this?" If yes, write the script.

**Should be scripts:**
- Validation (input format, required fields, schema compliance)
- File generation from templates
- Data extraction and transformation
- API calls with structured responses
- Setup and environment checks
- Output formatting
- Context loading (read project files, resolve paths, return JSON)
- Pin/unpin shortcuts (create/remove command aliases)
- Cleanup (remove deprecated files after skill updates)

**Should stay as instructions:**
- Deciding between architectural approaches
- Reviewing code for quality or style
- Explaining tradeoffs to the user
- Creative writing or design decisions
- Interview/discovery conversations

Key patterns:
- **Python without dependencies**: stdlib only, `argparse` for CLI parsing
- **Python with dependencies**: PEP 723 inline metadata with `uv run`
- **All scripts**: Structured output (JSON when piped), clear exit codes, descriptive `--help`

### Context loader pattern

For skills that need project-level context, write a loader script:

The script should follow all standard patterns: `argparse` with `--help`, structured JSON output (pretty when interactive, compact when piped), clear exit codes (0 = found, 1 = missing), `pathlib` for cross-platform paths, and stdlib-only imports. See the "Context File System" section in `references/architecture-patterns.md` for a skeleton.

The SKILL.md references it: "Load context via `python scripts/load_context.py`. Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, or `grep`."

## Phase 5: Review

Before presenting the final skill, verify against this checklist:

### Basics
- [ ] `name` is lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars
- [ ] `description` is under 1024 chars and includes trigger phrases
- [ ] `description` is slightly pushy — covers edge phrasings that should activate the skill
- [ ] SKILL.md body is under 500 lines
- [ ] Instructions use imperative form

### Architecture (if applicable)
- [ ] Sub-commands have a router table with clear routing rules
- [ ] `command-metadata.json` is the single source of truth for command descriptions
- [ ] Setup gates are defined with fail actions for each gate
- [ ] Register/mode system classifies before loading references
- [ ] Capability-gated steps degrade gracefully with one-line skip reasons

### References
- [ ] Domain knowledge split into `references/` with clear "when to read" pointers
- [ ] Each reference is self-contained — no transitive loading (see `spec-guide.md` → Reference Architecture)
- [ ] Reference loading is conditional, not eager ("Read X if Y happens")
- [ ] Shared concerns (auth, config) extracted into their own reference, not embedded in a consumer
- [ ] Error handling lives in the reference for the tool that produces the error
- [ ] Multi-approach skills include a decision table routing to the correct reference
- [ ] No browser-only tools referenced (Postman, API consoles, OAuth login pages)

### Scripts
- [ ] Scripts (if any) have shebangs, structured output, and `--help`
- [ ] Context loader returns JSON, handles missing files, resolves fallback paths
- [ ] Scripts are cross-platform (pathlib, tempfile, no hardcoded paths)
- [ ] Scripts are idempotent — safe to re-run

### API/Service Skills (if applicable)
- [ ] Credential files are never read into context — passed via shell substitution only
- [ ] Credential setup is single-sourced in its own reference file
- [ ] Capability gate checks for credentials before attempting API calls
- [ ] API schema discovery is documented (OpenAPI download, GraphQL introspection, or live endpoints)
- [ ] API examples have been validated against the live endpoint
- [ ] Instance-specific values include programmatic discovery methods

### Quality
- [ ] No time-sensitive information (URLs to specific versions, dates that will go stale)
- [ ] Examples use fake data where possible (emails, names, tokens) — see `spec-guide.md` → Fake Data in Examples
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Concrete examples included for non-obvious workflows
- [ ] Absolute bans defined for patterns that are always wrong
- [ ] Self-critique loops defined for build/implementation commands with explicit exit bars
