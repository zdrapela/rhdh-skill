# RHDH Prow CI Management

Manage Prow CI job configurations for RHDH in the `openshift/release` repository.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- For listing: works from any directory (auto-detects local checkout or uses GitHub API)
- For generating/modifying: requires a local `openshift/release` checkout

## Important: Branch Terminology

**"Branch" refers to the RHDH product branch** encoded in the config filename (e.g., `main`, `release-1.8`), **NOT** a git branch in `openshift/release`. All CI config files live on the `main` git branch.

## Identify Task

What CI management task do you need?

| Query matches | Workflow |
|---|---|
| "OCP test", "OCP job", "e2e-ocp", "add OCP version", "new OCP test" | `workflows/ocp-jobs.md` |
| "cluster pool", "ClusterPool", "Hive pool" | `workflows/ocp-pools.md` |
| "coverage", "gap analysis", "what OCP versions are missing" | `workflows/ocp-coverage.md` |
| "AKS test", "EKS test", "GKE test", "K8s platform jobs" | `workflows/k8s-jobs.md` |
| "decommission", "EOL release", "remove release branch", "clean up old release" | `workflows/decommission-release.md` |

After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.

## Available Scripts

All listing scripts support `--repo-dir` to override the openshift/release location and work in both local and remote (GitHub API) modes.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/list_ocp_test_configs.py` | List OCP test entries per branch |
| `scripts/generate_test_entry.py` | Generate a new OCP test entry YAML block |
| `scripts/list_cluster_pools.py` | List RHDH Hive ClusterPool configurations |
| `scripts/generate_cluster_pool.py` | Generate a new ClusterPool YAML file |
| `scripts/analyze_coverage.py` | Cross-reference coverage against lifecycle data |
| `scripts/list_aks_jobs.py` | List AKS test entries |
| `scripts/list_eks_jobs.py` | List EKS test entries |
| `scripts/list_gke_jobs.py` | List GKE test entries |

## After Any Change

Always run `make update` after modifying CI config files:

```bash
make update
```

This regenerates Prow job configs in `ci-operator/jobs/` and `zz_generated_metadata` sections.

- **`lifecycle`**: Provides repo resolution, YAML I/O, and lifecycle data.
  The `rhdh_prow` package delegates to `rhdh_lifecycle` for shared utilities.
