  Interact with RHDH Jira projects (RHIDP, RHDHPLAN, RHDHBUGS, RHDHSUPP) using the Atlassian CLI (acli). Use when the user needs to search, create, view, edit, transition, comment on, or link Jira issues for Red Hat Developer Hub. Also use when the user asks about Jira workflows, exit criteria, issue templates, custom fields, boards, sprints, or JQL queries in the RHDH context. Trigger when the user mentions Jira issue keys like RHIDP-1234, RHDHPLAN-567, RHDHBUGS-890, or any RHDH project key. Also trigger for support case bug filing, feature request creation, or release planning in Jira. Covers acli setup, authentication, and troubleshooting.

# RHDH Jira

Foundational skill for interacting with RHDH's Jira instance via the Atlassian CLI (`acli`). Covers all four active projects, issue types, workflows, custom fields, and JQL patterns.

## Prerequisites

Run `scripts/setup.py` to verify everything is configured:

```bash
python scripts/setup.py
```

The script checks:
1. `acli` binary on PATH
2. Jira API token auth configured (`~/.config/acli/jira_config.yaml`)
3. Smoke test against `redhat.atlassian.net`

If `acli` is not installed, download from [Atlassian CLI](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/). Authenticate with `acli auth login` or configure an API token.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/setup.py` | Verify acli install + auth. Run with `--json` for structured output. |
| `scripts/parse_issues.py` | Flatten, enrich, and filter acli JSON output. Solves the core problem: `acli search --json` can't return custom fields (team, story points, sprint). Pipe search results in, get clean data out. Use `--enrich` to fetch full fields, `-f team="X"` to filter by team. |

## Projects

| Key | Purpose | Issue Types |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| RHIDP | Engineering work | Epic, Story, Task, Sub-task, Vulnerability |
| RHDHPLAN | Program planning | Feature, Outcome, Feature Request, Sub-task |
| RHDHBUGS | Product defects | Bug, Sub-task |
| RHDHSUPP | Support-engineering interactions | Bug |

RHDHPAI (Plugins and AI) is **archived** — JQL queries against it will fail.

### Issue type selection

- **Story** — end-user facing work (API, UI changes)
- **Task** — not end-user facing (tests, CI/CD, refactoring, code organization)
- **Epic** — collection of Stories/Tasks toward a deliverable
- **Feature** — program-level planning item in RHDHPLAN
- **Bug** — product defect (RHDHBUGS) or support case tracking (RHDHSUPP)
- **Sub-task** — child of any issue type above
- **Vulnerability** — CVE tracking in RHIDP (Product Security)

## Reference Files

Load only what the current task requires.

| File | Load when... |
|------|-------------|
| `references/acli-commands.md` | Running an acli command you haven't used before, or hitting unexpected flag behavior. Quick reference for syntax, flag differences, and output formats. |
| `references/fields.md` | Need to know a field name, custom field ID, accepted values, or label conventions. Custom fields, labels, link types, components, priorities. |
| `references/workflows.md` | Transitioning issues, checking exit criteria, or verifying readiness for the next status. |
| `references/templates.md` | Creating new issues. Also load `references/workflows.md` for required fields at entry status. |
| `references/support.md` | Handling support cases, filing bugs from customer cases, or creating feature requests from support. |
| `references/jql-patterns.md` | Building a JQL query, finding a board ID, or looking up sprint information. JQL cookbook with 23+ tested queries. |

## Common Gotchas

1. **`acli auth status` lies.** It checks OAuth, not API token auth. Always returns "unauthorized" with token auth even when Jira works fine. Use `acli jira project list --recent 1` as a smoke test instead.
2. **`view` uses positional arg, everything else uses `--key`.** `acli jira workitem view RHIDP-123` but `acli jira workitem edit --key RHIDP-123 ...`.
3. **`--yes` is mandatory for mutations.** All `edit`, `transition`, `assign`, and `link create` commands prompt interactively without it. Always pass `--yes`.
4. **`--fields` is restrictive on search.** Only accepts `key`, `summary`, `status`, `assignee`, `issuetype`, `priority`, `description`, `labels`. For components, sprint, fixVersions, and all custom fields — use `--json` or `scripts/parse_issues.py --enrich`.
5. **Team field is NOT JQL-filterable.** `customfield_10001` cannot be used in JQL WHERE clauses. Fetch all issues, filter by `customfield_10001.name` in post-processing.
6. **ADF vs plain text.** Reading descriptions via `--json` returns Atlassian Document Format (nested JSON). Creating/editing with `--description` accepts plain text. Don't try to round-trip ADF through `--description`.
7. **Acceptance Criteria field is almost always null.** Scan the description for "Requirements", "Acceptance Criteria", or bullet-style criteria instead of checking `customfield_10718`.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `acli` not on PATH | Run `scripts/setup.py`. Install from Atlassian if missing. |
| "unauthorized" from `auth status` | Ignore. Check `jira_config.yaml` exists. Run smoke test. |
| "required flag(s) not set" | Command syntax wrong. Run `acli jira <subcommand> --help`. |
| "field X is not allowed" | Use `--json` instead of `--fields` for that field. |
| "the value X does not exist for the field 'project'" | Project key is wrong or project is archived (e.g., RHDHPAI). |
| Rate limiting (429) | Wait 5 seconds, retry once. |
| Interactive prompt hangs | Missing `--yes` flag on a mutating command. |

## Common Workflows

### Creating an issue
1. Load `references/templates.md` for the body template
2. Load `references/workflows.md` for required fields at New status
3. Run `acli jira workitem create` (see `references/acli-commands.md` if unsure of syntax)

### Searching with custom fields (team, story points, sprint)
1. Build JQL using patterns from `references/jql-patterns.md`
2. Pipe results through `scripts/parse_issues.py --enrich` for full field data
3. Use `-f team="X"` to filter by team (not possible in JQL)

### Transitioning an issue
1. Load `references/workflows.md` for exit criteria at the target status
2. Verify required fields are set before transitioning
3. Run `acli jira workitem transition --key KEY --status "X" --yes`

## When NOT to Use

- **Non-RHDH Jira projects** — this skill's field mappings, workflows, and JQL patterns are specific to RHIDP/RHDHPLAN/RHDHBUGS/RHDHSUPP
- **Jira REST API directly** — this skill covers `acli` CLI only
