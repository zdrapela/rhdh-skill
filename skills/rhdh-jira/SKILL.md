<routing>

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Show the command menu. Ask what to do.
2. **First word matches a command**: Load its reference file and follow it.
3. **First word doesn't match**: General Jira invocation using the full argument as context — use the reference files table below to decide what to load.

</routing>

## Prerequisites

Run `scripts/setup.py` to verify everything is configured:

```bash
python scripts/setup.py
```

The script checks:

1. `acli` binary on PATH
2. Jira API token auth configured (`~/.config/acli/jira_config.yaml`)
3. `.jira-token` file next to `acli` executable (for REST API fallback)
4. Smoke test against `redhat.atlassian.net`

If `acli` is not installed, download from [Atlassian CLI](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/) and follow the [Getting Started guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/guides/how-to-get-started/) for installation and authentication setup. Use API token authentication, not OAuth — OAuth sessions expire and `acli auth status` gives false negatives with token auth (see Gotchas).

### API preference order

All operations follow this priority: **acli → GraphQL → REST API**.

- **acli** — default for simple, single-issue operations (view, edit, assign, transition).
- **GraphQL** — for bulk reads where acli would be too slow (expertise profiles, capacity, refinement checks). Skip acli entirely for bulk.
- **REST API** — for writes when already in an authenticated API context (avoids shelling out to acli mid-workflow), or as fallback when acli fails for custom field updates.

Sub-commands (`assign`, `refine`) document which API they use. When a sub-command's workflow already has `AUTH` set from GraphQL reads, prefer REST for writes.

### REST/GraphQL capability gate

Before attempting any REST API or GraphQL call:

1. Run `python scripts/setup.py --json` and check `token_file_found`
2. If missing, state: "REST API/GraphQL fallback unavailable — `.jira-token` not configured. Run `setup.py` for instructions." Continue with acli-only workflow.
3. If the user needs REST/GraphQL, load `references/auth.md` for setup instructions

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/setup.py` | Verify acli install + auth. Run with `--json` for structured output. |
| `scripts/parse_issues.py` | Flatten, enrich, and filter acli JSON output. Solves the core problem: `acli search --json` can't return custom fields (team, story points, sprint). Pipe search results in, get clean data out. Use `--enrich` to fetch full fields, `-f team="X"` to filter by team. |
| `scripts/command-metadata.json` | Single source of truth for sub-command descriptions and argument hints. |

## Projects

| Key | Purpose | Issue Types |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| RHIDP | Engineering work | Epic, Story, Task, Sub-task, Vulnerability |
| RHDHPLAN | Program planning | Feature, Outcome, Feature Request, Sub-task |
| RHDHBUGS | Product defects | Bug, Sub-task |
| RHDHSUPP | Support-engineering interactions | Bug |

RHDHPAI (Plugins and AI) is **archived** — JQL queries against it will fail.

### Issue type selection

- **Story** — end-user facing work (API, UI changes)
- **Task** — not end-user facing (tests, CI/CD, refactoring, code organization)
- **Epic** — collection of Stories/Tasks toward a deliverable
- **Feature** — program-level planning item in RHDHPLAN
- **Bug** — product defect (RHDHBUGS) or support case tracking (RHDHSUPP)
- **Sub-task** — child of any issue type above
- **Vulnerability** — CVE tracking in RHIDP (Product Security)

## Common Gotchas

1. **`acli auth status` lies.** It checks OAuth, not API token auth. Always returns "unauthorized" with token auth even when Jira works fine. Use `acli jira project list --recent 1` as a smoke test instead.
2. **`view` uses positional arg, everything else uses `--key`.** `acli jira workitem view RHIDP-123` but `acli jira workitem edit --key RHIDP-123 ...`.
3. **`--yes` is mandatory for mutations.** All `edit`, `transition`, `assign`, and `link create` commands prompt interactively without it. Always pass `--yes`.
4. **`--fields` is restrictive on search.** Only accepts `key`, `summary`, `status`, `assignee`, `issuetype`, `priority`, `description`, `labels`. For components, sprint, fixVersions, and all custom fields — use `--json` or `scripts/parse_issues.py --enrich`.
5. **Team field has two JQL syntaxes.** `customfield_10001` cannot be used in JQL WHERE clauses. However, `"Team[Team]" = {teamId}` (using the team UUID, not display name) works. Use the UUID syntax for JQL filtering; use `customfield_10001.name` in post-processing only when you need the display name from JSON output.
6. **ADF vs plain text.** Reading descriptions via `--json` returns Atlassian Document Format (nested JSON). Creating/editing with `--description` accepts plain text. Don't try to round-trip ADF through `--description`.
7. **Acceptance Criteria field is almost always null.** Scan the description for "Requirements", "Acceptance Criteria", or bullet-style criteria instead of checking `customfield_10718`.
8. **`--enrich` is MANDATORY for custom fields AND labels.** Both `acli search --json` and `acli view KEY --json` (without `--fields "*all"`) return only basic fields (assignee, issuetype, priority, status, summary). Labels, story points, team, sprint, size, and components will all appear as empty/null — looking like the data isn't set when it actually is. Always use `scripts/parse_issues.py --enrich` to get custom field data. Skipping `--enrich` is the #1 cause of false "missing data" reports.
9. **`acli` cannot set arbitrary custom fields.** `acli jira workitem edit` does not have a `--custom` flag. Fields like Team, Size, Story Points, and Release Note Type can only be updated via the Jira REST API. Use `PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{key}` with the field payload (see `references/rest-api-fallback.md` for curl examples and payload formats). Find the token file at `.jira-token` next to the `acli` executable (discover the path with `readlink -f "$(which acli)"` or `where acli`). Never read the token file into context.
10. **`acli sprint list-workitems --json` wraps results in `{"issues": [...]}`.**  The output is NOT a flat array — it's an object with an `issues` key. Extract the array before piping to `parse_issues.py`. See `references/acli-commands.md` for the workaround command.
11. **GraphQL search is beta.** `issueSearchStable` requires `X-ExperimentalApi: JiraIssueSearch` header. Load `references/graphql-queries.md` before attempting GraphQL queries.
12. **`.jira-token` format is `email:token`, not bare token.** A file containing only the API token without the email prefix will cause 401 errors on REST/GraphQL calls. The `setup.py` script validates the format.
13. **`acli search` silently truncates results.** The default page size is 30. If your JQL matches more than 30 issues, you get the first 30 with no warning. Always pass `--limit 200` for bulk queries, or use `--count` first to check the total, then `--paginate` to fetch all pages. This is the #2 cause of incorrect reports after skipping `--enrich`.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `acli` not on PATH | Run `scripts/setup.py`. Install from Atlassian if missing. See [Getting Started](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/guides/how-to-get-started/). |
| "unauthorized" from `auth status` | Ignore. Check `jira_config.yaml` exists. Run smoke test. |
| "required flag(s) not set" | Command syntax wrong. Run `acli jira <subcommand> --help`. |
| "field X is not allowed" | Use `--json` instead of `--fields` for that field. |
| "the value X does not exist for the field 'project'" | Project key is wrong or project is archived (e.g., RHDHPAI). |
| Rate limiting (429) | Wait 5 seconds, retry once. |
| Interactive prompt hangs | Missing `--yes` flag on a mutating command. |
| Custom field update fails via `acli` | Fall back to Jira REST API using `.jira-token` file. See Gotcha #9. |
| `issueSearchStable` returns errors | Fall back to `acli` search (not REST — `/rest/api/3/search` returns 410 Gone on this instance). Warn that the beta API failed. |

## Team Conventions

These apply across all sub-commands:

- **Release Pending counts as completed.** Release Pending items remain in the sprint and count toward velocity and capacity. They represent done work awaiting release.
- **Confirmation flow.** Sub-commands that modify Jira issues use a standard prompt: `"Apply changes? [y/N/edit]"` — **y** applies all, **N** cancels, **edit** steps through each change individually.
- **Closure requires rationale.** When closing or descoping issues, always add a comment documenting the reason and set the resolution field (`Won't Do`, `Duplicate`, `Done`). Preserves the decision trail.
- **Comments over description bloat.** Issue descriptions use the structured template sections. Decision trail, elaboration, abandoned approaches, and customer context go in comments. Creation commands proactively suggest comments for context that emerged during the grill.

## Common Workflows

> Sub-commands share data. `plan` reuses roster/capacity/expertise from `assign`. `sprint-report` uses the same velocity query pattern as `plan`. `release` references exit criteria from `workflows.md` and can invoke `assign` for unassigned Features.

### Creating an issue

1. Load `references/templates.md` for the body template
2. Load `references/workflows.md` for required fields at New status
3. Run `acli jira workitem create` (see `references/acli-commands.md` if unsure of syntax)

### Searching with custom fields (team, story points, sprint)

1. Build JQL using patterns from `references/jql-patterns.md`
2. Pipe results through `scripts/parse_issues.py --enrich` for full field data
3. Use `-f team="X"` to filter by team (not possible in JQL)

### Transitioning an issue

1. Load `references/workflows.md` for exit criteria at the target status
2. Verify required fields are set before transitioning
3. Run `acli jira workitem transition --key KEY --status "X" --yes`

### Complex queries (many fields, relationships)

1. Load `references/graphql-queries.md`
2. Use `issueByKey` for single issues or `issueSearchStable` (beta) for JQL search
3. Fall back to `acli` + `parse_issues.py --enrich` if GraphQL returns errors

### Recommending and assigning issues

1. Load `references/assign.md`
2. Identify unassigned issues (single key, JQL query, or passed-in list)
3. Determine the team (from issue field, parent epic, or user input)
4. Run deep or quick analysis per the reference
5. Present recommendations, get user confirmation, then assign

### Refining issues

1. Load `references/refine.md`
2. Identify issues to refine (specific keys, JQL, `sprint`, or `backlog`)
3. Run all 6 checks: missing fields, duplicates, hierarchy, comments, staleness, sprint readiness
4. Present refinement report with actionable recommendations
5. Optionally apply auto-fixable changes and prompt for manual decisions

### Sprint planning prep

1. Load `references/plan.md`
2. Resolve team, board, and sprint context
3. Generate carryover report, velocity trend, capacity snapshot, and ready-for-planning queue
4. Auto-generate sprint fill suggestions with expertise matching
5. Surface critical customer bugs (exempt from capacity) and retro action items

### Sprint review summary

1. Load `references/sprint-report.md`
2. Resolve sprint (active or previous)
3. Partition completed vs carried over, compute completion rate
4. Per-member breakdown, epic progress, demo checklist with naming conventions
5. Optionally save as markdown file

### Release readiness

1. Load `references/release.md`
2. Fetch Features for the target version/label
3. Quick mode: PI funnel, feature matrix, readiness score
4. Deep mode: adds epic roll-up, dependency map, coherence analysis, RN readiness, risk assessment
5. Optionally remediate (assign owners, create Epics, transition statuses)

### Creating Features, Epics, and Issues

1. Load the appropriate creation reference (`to-feature.md`, `to-epic.md`, or `to-issue.md`)
2. Load `references/grill.md` for challenging behavior
3. Load the template + example pair from `assets/templates/` and `assets/examples/`
4. Grill the user on scope, AC, sizing (reference `references/sizing.md`)
5. Run duplicate check per `references/duplicates.md`
6. Create the issue, suggest comments for decision trail
7. Offer chained decomposition (Feature → Epics → Stories/Tasks)

### Updating Jira from a session

1. Load `references/update-jira-status.md`
2. Detect related issue (conversation → git → PR → commits → keyword search)
3. Compose status comment, propose transition
4. Check upward cascade (sibling completion → parent transition)
5. Suggest reaching out to Feature Owner if Feature-level work is complete

### Discovering unknown fields or endpoints

1. For REST: load `references/rest-api-fallback.md` — use the OpenAPI spec or `/rest/api/3/field` endpoint
2. For GraphQL: load `references/graphql-queries.md` — use `__type` introspection queries
3. Do not guess field IDs or types — always verify against the live schema

## When NOT to Use

- **Non-RHDH Jira projects** — this skill's field mappings, workflows, and JQL patterns are specific to RHIDP/RHDHPLAN/RHDHBUGS/RHDHSUPP
- **Jira REST API directly** — use `acli` first, then GraphQL for bulk reads. REST API is the last resort for writes when acli fails and for schema discovery via OpenAPI spec (see Gotcha #9)
- **GraphQL for simple lookups** — use `acli` for single-issue views and simple searches. GraphQL is for bulk operations, complex queries needing relationships or many custom fields in one call, team roster lookups, and schema introspection
