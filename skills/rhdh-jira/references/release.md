# Release Status

Generate a release readiness report: feature status matrix, Program Increment funnel, epic roll-up, dependency map, blocker bugs, release notes readiness, and risk assessment. Replaces the standalone `rhdh-release-triage` skill — consolidates all release triage functionality into this sub-command.

Supports quick mode (ceremony prep, ~5 API calls) and deep mode (full coherence analysis with per-feature assessment, ~20+ calls).

Uses GraphQL for bulk reads (skip acli). Writes follow the API preference order in SKILL.md.

Authentication setup: see `references/auth.md`. All examples below assume `AUTH`, `CLOUD_ID`, and `GRAPHQL_URL` are set per that file.

## Input

The caller provides:

1. **Release version** — e.g., `2.1`, `1.10`. Matches against candidate labels (`rhdh-2.1-candidate`) and fix versions.
2. **Team** — optional. If provided, filter to that team's Features/Epics only. If omitted, show all teams (program-level view).

## Mode Selection

> "Release status for {version}. **Quick** (ceremony prep, feature matrix + funnel) or **deep** (full coherence analysis, per-feature assessment)? [quick/deep]"

Default to **quick** if not specified.

## Quick Mode

### Step 1 — Fetch Features

Query RHDHPLAN Features with the candidate label or fix version. Replace `VERSION` with the target release version (e.g., `2.1`):

```bash
curl -s -u "$AUTH" "$GRAPHQL_URL" -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-ExperimentalApi: JiraIssueSearch' \
  -d '{
    "query": "query ReleaseFeatures { jira { issueSearchStable(cloudId: \"'"$CLOUD_ID"'\", issueSearchInput: {jql: \"project = RHDHPLAN AND issuetype = Feature AND (labels = \\\"rhdh-VERSION-candidate\\\" OR fixVersion = \\\"VERSION\\\") ORDER BY priority ASC\"}, first: 50) { totalCount edges { node { key summary status { name } priority { name } assignee { name } storyPoints fields { edges { node { __typename name ... on JiraSingleSelectField { fieldOption { value } } ... on JiraLabelsField { labels { edges { node { name } } } } } } } } } } } }"
  }'
```

For team field, use REST fallback per issue: `GET /rest/api/3/issue/{key}?fields=customfield_10001`

### Step 2 — Program Increment Funnel

Classify each Feature into PI release planning states based on its field values:

| PI State | Condition |
|----------|-----------|
| **Candidate Definition** | Labels include `needs-pm` or `needs-info` |
| **Defined but No Team** | Team field is empty |
| **Exploration** | Size is empty OR assignee is empty |
| **Ready for Commitment** | Size set, assignee set, has child Epics, fix version is empty |
| **Fixversion Set** | Fix version is set (committed to release) |

Show the funnel as a count breakdown:

```markdown
### Program Increment Funnel
| Stage | Count | Features |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ⚠ Candidate Definition (blocked on PM) | 2 | RHDHPLAN-402, RHDHPLAN-410 |
| ⚠ Defined but No Team | 1 | RHDHPLAN-415 |
| 🔍 Exploration | 3 | ... |
| ✅ Ready for Commitment | 2 | ... |
| ✅ Fixversion Set | 4 | ... |
```

### Step 3 — Feature Status Matrix

Map each Feature to its Jira workflow status with color coding:

| Icon | Status range |
|------|-------------|
| 🔴 | New, Refinement |
| 🟡 | Backlog |
| 🟢 | In Progress |
| ✅ | Release Pending, Closed |

Include: key, summary, status, owner, team, size, stretch flag.

### Step 4 — Stretch Features

Features with `stretch` label listed separately as descope candidates. These are first to cut if the release is at risk.

### Step 4b — Label Checks

For each Feature, verify expected labels:

| Label | Required when | Flag if missing |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| `demo` | Customer-facing Feature | "Customer-facing Feature missing `demo` label — needs Feature Demo." |
| `test-day` | Test Day candidate | Informational only — note if present. |
| Documentation component | Feature requires docs | "No Documentation component — will Docs team create an Epic?" |

### Step 5 — Readiness Score

```
readiness = (Features in In Progress or later) / total Features × 100
```

Breakdown by status bucket.

### Step 6 — PM Blockers

Features with `needs-pm` or `needs-info` labels surfaced prominently:

```markdown
### ⏳ Waiting on PM ({count})
| Feature | Summary | Label | Days since label added |
```

## Deep Mode

Includes everything from quick mode, plus:

### Step 7 — Epic Roll-up

For each Feature, query child Epics:

```bash
jql: "issuetype = Epic AND parent = {feature_key}"
```

If 0 results, retry with legacy Epic Link: `"Epic Link" = {feature_key}` (older data may use this instead of `parent`).

Count Epics by status. Compute percent complete. Flag mismatches:

- Feature is "In Progress" but no child Epics are in progress → "Stale Feature status"
- Feature is "Backlog" but child Epics are "In Progress" → "Feature status behind Epics"

Load `references/workflows.md` for the exit criteria validation on each Feature and Epic.

### Step 8 — Dependency Map

Scan `Blocks` and `Depend` issue links on Features and Epics. Filter to **cross-team and cross-project** dependencies only (same-team internal deps are noise).

For each dependency:

- Source issue (key, team, status)
- Target issue (key, team, status)
- Risk: is the blocker not started? Is it in a different team? Is it in a different project?

```markdown
### Dependencies (cross-team)
| Source | Depends on | Target Team | Target Status | Risk |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------------|------|
| RHIDP-200 (COPE) | RHIDP-300 | Install Method | New | 🔴 not started |
```

### Step 9 — Blocker/Critical Bugs

Bugs in RHDHBUGS with the release fix version and priority Blocker or Critical:

```bash
jql: "project = RHDHBUGS AND priority in (Blocker, Critical) AND fixVersion = VERSION AND status != Closed"
```

Include: key, summary, status, assignee, days since last update.

### Step 10 — Release Notes Readiness

For Features and Epics in Release Pending or Closed, check:

- Release Note Type (`customfield_10785`) is set
- Release Note Text (`customfield_10783`) is set

Flag missing: "RN fields not set — required before closing."

### Step 11 — Per-Feature Coherence Analysis

For each Feature, assess:

1. Are exit criteria met for current status? (reference `workflows.md`)
2. Are all child Epics sized?
3. Are child Epics assigned to teams?
4. Are there child Epics without Stories/Tasks (if Epic is in To Do+)?
5. Is there a Design Doc or RFE link (if Feature is in Refinement+)?

Produce a coherence score per Feature: `checks_passed / total_checks × 100`.

### Step 12 — Risk Assessment

Synthesize a 1-paragraph risk assessment:

- How many Features are blocked (on PM, on dependencies, on bugs)?
- What's the readiness score?
- Are there stale Features (New status, no activity)?
- Stretch feature count vs committed count
- Recommend: specific actions (assign, descope, escalate)

## Remediation

After presenting the report:

> "Fix issues? [y/N/edit]"

**⚠ Automation warning:** Setting fix version on a Feature cascades to all child Epics automatically (Jira automation rule). Setting Epic status also cascades to parent Feature. See `references/workflows.md` Automation Rules. Warn the user before applying fix version changes.

Available actions (all require user confirmation):

- **Set fix version** on Features in "Ready for Commitment" (cascades to child Epics)
- **Create missing Epics** (Eng, QE, Doc) for Features in Backlog+
- **Transition Feature status** when exit criteria are met
- **Assign owner** to unassigned Features (invokes `assign` sub-command)
- **Add missing RN fields** — prompt user for Release Note Type and Text

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No Features match version/label | "No Features found. Check version name or label." |
| RHDHPLAN inaccessible | Stop. User lacks project access. |
| RHIDP inaccessible | Warn. Continue without Epic data. |
| Team field REST call fails | Skip team filtering. Show all Features. |
| Epic query returns 0 children | Note "no child Epics" — this is a finding, not an error. |
| `issueSearchStable` fails | Fall back to REST. |

## Caveats

1. **Intended to replace `rhdh-release-triage`.** This sub-command covers ceremony prep (PI funnel, feature matrix, readiness score) and most deep analysis. For detailed per-feature checklists (15+ checks), Mermaid diagrams, and run history trending, the standalone `rhdh-release-triage` skill remains more thorough until feature parity is reached.
2. **Team field requires REST fallback.** One REST call per Feature for team data. For 12 Features, this is 12 extra calls in quick mode.
3. **Coherence analysis is deep-mode only.** Quick mode skips per-feature exit criteria validation and epic child checks.
4. **PI funnel states are computed, not stored.** Jira doesn't have a "PI State" field — the funnel is derived from field values (labels, size, assignee, fix version).
5. **Cross-team dependency detection requires issue links.** Features/Epics without `Blocks`/`Depend` links won't show in the dependency map even if real dependencies exist.
