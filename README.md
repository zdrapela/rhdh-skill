# RHDH Skill

Agent skills for the Red Hat Developer Hub team. Covers plugin development, overlay management, local testing, Jira workflows, and day-to-day RHDH engineering — so your agent knows the ecosystem instead of hallucinating through it.

> **Quick start:** `npx skills add redhat-developer/rhdh-skill` — works with [50+ coding agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#supported-agents).

## Why This Exists

RHDH spans a dozen repositories, four Jira projects, version-specific Backstage compatibility, overlay CI pipelines, and a copy-sync customization system for local testing. Without guidance, agents hallucinate version numbers, use the legacy backend system, construct OCI URLs by hand, and miss project-specific conventions that are impossible to learn from training data alone.

These skills encode the gotchas, workflows, and tribal knowledge so you don't re-explain them every session.

## What's Inside

### Plugin Development

Build dynamic plugins from scratch — backend or frontend — and get them deployed.

- **[create-plugin](./skills/create-plugin/SKILL.md)** — Full plugin lifecycle: scaffold, implement, export, package, and wire RHDH dynamic plugins. Sub-commands for `backend`, `frontend`, `export`, and `wiring`.
  - **[backend](./skills/create-plugin/references/backend.md)** — Backend plugins (APIs, scaffolder actions, catalog processors) using the new backend system.
  - **[frontend](./skills/create-plugin/references/frontend.md)** — Frontend plugins (pages, entity cards, themes) with Scalprum federation.
  - **[export](./skills/create-plugin/references/export.md)** — Export, package (OCI/tgz/npm), and push to a container registry.
  - **[wiring](./skills/create-plugin/references/wiring.md)** — Analyze plugin source and generate `dynamic-plugins.yaml` wiring config.

### Extensions Catalog

Manage plugins in the [rhdh-plugin-export-overlays](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays) repository.

- **[overlay](./skills/overlay/SKILL.md)** — Onboard new plugins, update versions, fix CI failures, triage and analyze PRs, trigger `/publish`. Covers both plugin-owner and core-team workflows.

### Local Testing

Test plugins in a local RHDH instance before deploying.

- **[rhdh-local](./skills/rhdh-local/SKILL.md)** — Enable/disable plugins, switch between customized and pristine configs, run health checks, backup/restore configurations via the `rhdh-local-setup` customization system.

### Jira

Track work across the four RHDH Jira projects.

- **[rhdh-jira](./skills/rhdh-jira/SKILL.md)** — Search, create, view, edit, transition, and link issues across RHIDP, RHDHPLAN, RHDHBUGS, and RHDHSUPP. Uses `acli` with REST API and GraphQL fallback for custom fields.

### Orchestration

- **[rhdh](./skills/rhdh/SKILL.md)** — Entry point and router. Detects your environment, runs `doctor` checks, maintains a cross-session worklog, and routes to the right skill. Start here if you're not sure what you need.

### Meta

- **[skill-maker](./skills/skill-maker/SKILL.md)** — Create new skills or consolidate existing ones following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification). Interviews you about scope and edge cases before drafting.

## Getting Started

Install the skills, then just talk to your agent. Mention what you're working on — onboarding a plugin, triaging PRs, creating a new backend module, checking Jira issues — and the right skill activates automatically.

If your agent doesn't pick up the right skill, or you want to start from the top, the `rhdh` orchestrator skill runs environment checks and routes you:

```
Tell my agent: "I need to onboard a new plugin to the Extensions Catalog"
```

Not everything needs every tool. Each skill checks for its own prerequisites and tells you what's missing.

## Installation

### Skills CLI (any agent)

```bash
npx skills add redhat-developer/rhdh-skill
```

Supports Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Pi, and [50+ more](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#supported-agents).

```bash
# List available skills without installing
npx skills add redhat-developer/rhdh-skill --list

# Install a specific skill only
npx skills add redhat-developer/rhdh-skill --skill create-plugin

# Target a specific agent
npx skills add redhat-developer/rhdh-skill -a claude-code
```

### Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add redhat-developer/rhdh-skill
claude plugin install --scope project rhdh
```

### Local Checkout (development)

```bash
npx skills add ./path/to/rhdh-skill
```

> **Note:** Always install in project scope. The skills reference repository-specific paths.

## Development
